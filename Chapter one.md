* database is a collection of related data
* A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the 
miniworld or the universe of discourse (UoD).

* database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning.

* random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a database.

* meta-data descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary 

* database management system (DBMS) is a computerized system that enables users to create and maintain a database

* Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium

* Sharing a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously

* Manipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the database to reflect 
  changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the d

* A query typically causes some data to be retrieved

* transaction may cause some data to be read and some data to be written into the database

* Protection includes:- 
* system protection against hardware or software malfunction (or crashes) 
* security protection against unauthorized or malicious access.

* maintain the database system by allowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time.

* The information stored in the catalog is called meta-data

* Data Abstraction:- allows program-data independence and program-operation independence

* User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these operations through their names and arguments, regardless of how the operations are 
implemented. This may be termed program-operation independence.

* data model is a type of data abstraction that is used to provide this conceptual representation. The data 
model uses logical concepts, such as objects

* abstraction process includes not only the data structure but also the operations on the data.

*  use abstraction  without knowing its details

* DBMS must include concurrency control software to ensure that several users trying to update the same data

* isolation property ensures that each transaction appears to execute in isolation from other transactions

* atomicity property ensures that either all the database operations in a transaction are executed or none are

* database administrator (DBA). The DBA is responsible for authorizing access to the database, coordinating and monitoring its use

* Database designers are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the database and for choosing appropriate structures to represent and store this data

* End users are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating reports (programmer)

* System analysts determine the requirements of end users

* Application programmers implement these specifications as programs
