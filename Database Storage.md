# Database storage
* refers to the methods and systems used to store and manage data in databases
* Database storage is a fundamental aspect of data management, impacting the performance, scalability, and reliability of applications that depend on database systems.
  
# Storage Architecture
* Disk Storage: Traditional storage on HDDs or SSDs.
* In-Memory Storage: Data is stored in RAM for faster access. Often used for caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached).

# Data Storage Models:
* Relational Databases: Store data in tables with rows and columns. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
* NoSQL Databases: Store data in various formats such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-family, and graph databases. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

# Data Organization
* Tables: In relational databases, data is organized into tables, which consist of rows (records) and columns (attributes).
* Collections and Documents: In document-oriented NoSQL databases, data is stored in collections of documents (EX :- JSON or BSON)

# Indexing:
* Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of data. They provide a way to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a table.

# Replication:
* Copying and maintaining database objects in multiple database servers. It ensures high availability and disaster recovery.

# Data Partitioning:
* Dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions or shards. This helps in scaling and managing large datasets

# Backup and Recovery:
* Techniques for creating copies of the database at a point in time. Essential for data protection and recovery from failures

# Data Compression:
* Reducing the size of the data stored to save space and potentially improve performance.
